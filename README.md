# Code Examples

A collection of code examples that I find useful as starting points for some of my
work.

## Download

Just clone this Git repository:

  git clone https://github.com/laurentgauthier/code-examples

In addition to this code you will also need a fresh clone of the YAML-cpp C++ library:

  git clone https://github.com/jbeder/yaml-cpp

## Build

These code examples are built using `cmake`, so make sure to have it installed.

  mkdir -p build/code-examples
  cd build/code-examples
  cmake ../../code-examples
